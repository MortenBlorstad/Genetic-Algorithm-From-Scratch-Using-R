Consider the following example, you are presented with 9 different gems. You can pick as many gems as you want, but the total weight of selected gems cannot exceed 10. Which gems do you pick in order to get the highest value?

Given a set of 9 genes (one gene for each gem), each gene can hold one of the binary values 0 and 1 (0 = not selected, 1=selected).

The fitness score is calculated based on the value of the gems selected. If the weight of the gems exceeds 10, the fitness score is set to zero. The individuals are sorted based on the fitness score and the ones with the highest score are selected.

Based on the result of the Genetic algorithm, you should pick the red, blue, green and black gem, which results in the highest value considering the weight-restriction of 10.
